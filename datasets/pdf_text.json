        "content": "Professional land surveyors\u2019 fi rst role is to serve the best interests of \nthe public. Their work is crucial to responsible land development \nand property management. Surveyors determine property \nboundaries and features, identify easements and encroachments, \nhelp private landowners from m aking costly boundary line mistakes \nand ensure that building codes and regulations are enforced to \nprotect the public. There are several services that only a licensed \nprofessional surveyor can provide, including surveys for property \ntitles and real estate financing, insurance, boundaries, and \nconstruction. If you think you need a land surveyor and don\u2019t know \nwhere to start, this short guide will help.  \nIf you have more questions, visit plso.org/surveyor .  \nOr to fi nd a surveyor, visit plso.org/fi nd  to get started!  \n \nWhen do I need a land surveyor?  \nProperty line disputes and contractual sales are often why one \nmight need to hire a surveyor. Below is a list the common types \nof surveys that an individual might need:  \n1. American Land Title Association Survey (A.L.T.A.):  Provides a \nproperty title company and mortgage lender with location \ndata for issuing a property title and mortgage insurance, such \nas the boundaries, easements, and the location of \nimprovements (structures, fences, utility lines, roads, etc.).  \n2. Boundary: Locates property corners and boundary lines of \nproperty.  \n3. Floodplain:  Determines the elevation of a building or piece of \nland and whether it is located within a fl  oodplain.  \n4. Property Survey:  Determines the legal property boundary,   \nwhen it has already been described in legal documents.  \n5. Construction: Provides measurements for erecting \nimprovements, such as roads, buildings and pipelines.  \n6. Land Development:  When a lot is split into two or more \nparcels, showing property corners and survey data for legal \ntitle and description.  \nFrequently asked questions  \n \n \n Who can provide me with an official survey?  \nOnly a licensed professional land surveyor may provide a legal land \nsurvey and create or modify boundaries or easements. Professionals \nlicensed through the Oregon State Board of Examiners for Engineering \nand Land Surveying (OSBEELS) are authorized to provi de legal land \nsurveys or  create or modify surveys in Oregon. Learn more about \nOSBEELS at  oregon.gov/osbeels . \nWhat do I look for when hiring a surveyor?  \nAlways consider qualifications and if a surveyor is licensed to work in the \nstate. As any other profession, references and past projects are a good \nindicator. Price is not the sole indicator of the quality of work a surveyor \nmay do for you. A land surveyor  acts on the behalf of the public and may \nappear for you in planning commission meetings or in a court of law. \nSurveyors often communicate with your neighbors on your behalf. Make \nsure you are comfortable with the surveyor you hire, and that you both \nhave a clear understanding of what you\u2019re trying to accomplish. Make \nsure to clearly define the scope of work by clarifying goals and \nexpectations.  \nWill a land surveyor tell me where my  boundary \nlines are?  \nIn Oregon, as in most states, only a court of law can decide questions  \nof property ownership. Your land surveyor locates the boundaries of \nthe property on the ground as described in your deed, marking the \nproperty corners with physical monuments if none e xist, provides a \nmap, and documents survey results. This map will be recorded with \nthe County Surveyor in the county in which the property is located. If \nconflicts exist,  your land surveyor will advise on property remedies. \nBoundary disagreements may need  to be resolved by a court of law; \nonly  the courts can settle ownership disputes.  \nWill I know if encroachments on the property exist?  \nPossible encroachments are identified as part of the survey. \nEncroachments may not have to be shown on the map submitted for \nfiling with the county surveyor. A separate map may be necessary.  \nWill I know if easements exist on my property?  \n \n \n An easement grants another entity the right to cross or use your  land \nfor a specific purpose, such as a utility company. A surveyor can \ndetermine this if a title report is provided by the owner or ordered \nduring the survey. The owner should make it clear to the land  \nsurveyor what additional information should be disclosed by the \nsurvey. Researching one boundary is generally the same as surveying \nthe entire parcel. If the property has not been surveyed in a long time \nor boundary monuments have disappeared,  a complete boundary \nsurvey is the most  cost -effective.  \nHow can there be conflicting boundary \nand easement lines?  \nBoundary and easement line disputes, gaps, and overlaps are \nsometimes a result of faulty legal descriptions that were originally \nwritten and recorded by persons lacking proper qualifications. It is \ncritical to have property lines clearly described and surv eyed when \nboundaries or easement lines are created or changed. Under \ncurrent law, any newly -created and most adjusted boundary lines \nrequire a survey and processing through governmental agencies. A \nproperty survey may reduce potential boundary and easement  \nconflicts or resolve outstanding issues.  \nWhy do I need an Elevation Certificate for my property \nand how do I get it?  \nAn Elevation Certificate is one way to comply with the National \nFlood Insurance Program requirements. It is required to properly \nrate certain structures for flood insurance premiums. Elevation \nCertificates must  be prepared and certified by a Licensed Land  \nSurveyor.  \nHow will I know what has been surveyed?  \nYour land surveyor will perform the survey in accordance with the \nmutually agreed upon scope of work. If the scope of work calls for \nmonumentation, property corners will be marked with steel rods or \nother permanent monuments, and a survey will be filed. Th e \nproperty corners should be shown to the owner. A survey map will \nbe filed whenever property corners are set indicating dimensions of \nproperty lines and other relative data as required by state law.  \n \n \n Understanding Survey Costs  \nLike anything else, it depends on the amount of time and \ndetail needed for the scope of work. Below are examples \nof scenarios that may affect the cost:  \n\u2022 Type of Survey  \n\u2022 Type of Deed Description  \n\u2022 Amount of Record Research Needed  \n\u2022 Property Size and Shape  \n\u2022 Terrain and Vegetation  \n\u2022 Accessibility to Property and Neighbor Relationships  \n\u2022 Amount of Existing Evidence on Property  \n\u2022 Time of Year  \n\u2022 Title Company or Lender Requirements  \n\u2022 County Fees  \n \nThere are many variables that make it difficult to determine exact \ncosts in advance. Based on experience, your land surveyor should \nbe able to provide a cost estimate. The land surveyor you choose \nmay require a contract for their services that details the work to \nbe done and the compensation required.  \nFind a surveyor at plso.org/find .  \nMore questions?

        "content": "35 12. Land Taxation  \n \nNational Tax Research Center. Land Taxation Measures to Complement the Comprehensive \nAgrarian Reform Program (CARP). Study Proper (Volume II). January 1994.  \n \nThe study explores the feasibility of adopting the progressive agricultural land tax and a land -use \nconversion tax and restructuring the idle land tax to raise revenue and attain the redistribution aspects of \nland reform. The study consisted of two (2) pha ses: a) the design and construction of a progressive and \nequitable structure for the Progressive Agricultural Land Tax (PALT), Land -Use Conversion Tax (LCT) \nand Idle Land Tax (ILT); and (b) a field survey which solicited the opinions of various stakeholder s. The \nstudy proposes PALT model which will adopt hectarage as the basis of gradation and presents three (3) \nrate structures with different revenue potentials and possibly varied effects on the achievement of land \nreform objectives. These three (3) rate st ructures are as follows: 1) Option A with rates of five (5) percent \nfor lands over seven (7) hectares to 24 hectares, 10 percent for lands over 24 hectares to 50 hectares, \n15 percent for lands over 50 hectares, while lands of seven (7) hectares or less are  exempt from PALT; \n2) Option B with rates of 10 percent for lands over seven (7) hectares to 24 hectares, 20 percent for lands \nover 24 to 50 hectares, 30 percent for lands over 50 hectares, while lands of seven (7) hectares or less \nare exempt from LCT; and  3) Option C with rates of 10 percent for lands over seven (7) hectares to 24 \nhectares, 20 percent for lands over 24 to 50 hectares, 50 percent for lands over 50 hectares, while lands \nof seven (7) hectares or less are exempt from ILT. The study proposes tw o (2) prototypes for LCT \nstructure such as: the full value model and the increment value model. The full value model of the LCT \nwill be based on the full current market value (CMV) of the agricultural land after conversion. Under the \nincrement value model,  the base of the tax is the \u201cunearned increment\u201d. The \u201cunearned increment\u201d is the \nincrease in the land value as a result of the change in land use thus, the tax will be imposed only on the \ndifference in the current market value before and after conversion.  On the other hand, the study proposes \nthat ILT may be imposed at a fixed rate of five (5) percent of the assessed value or at progressive \n(graduated fixed) rates based on the number of years the land remains idle, as follows: a) first five (5) \nyears the l and remains idle, five (5) percent of either the market value or assessed value; b) six (6) years \nto 10 years, 10 percent of either the market value or assessed value; and c) 11 years and above, 15 \npercent of either the market value or assessed value. The above -mentioned land tax measures are \nenvisioned to be national impositions. The PALT and ILT will be administered by the local government \nunits (LGUs) using the present realty tax mechanism, while the LCT will be implemented by DAR."
